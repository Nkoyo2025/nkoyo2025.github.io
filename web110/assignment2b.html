    <p>SEARCH BETTER: This video explains how to search for information on the web using the Google Search Engine. I learned about the basic search strategies, tips for reading webpages, getting more out of Google search, hidden features of Google search and judging online information. Judging online information deals with identifying if the information you get online is factual, accurate, reliable or sensationalized. Trustworthy websites offer objective, fact-based information, and it is essential that one verifies where the website got the information from and confirms that the website is not distorting the truth, due to bias or trying to influence you toward an assumption. I learned some ways to verify information through checking the same information across multiple sites, or utilizing fact checking sites like, politifact.com, factcheck.org or snopes.com. These sites specialize in researching current events and claims and equally provide reliable sources for you to verify the information you need. I also learned about some hidden features of Google search that simplifies your experience while browsing the web. These hidden features highlighted the benefits of using phrases like, near me, solve, define, and translate to narrow down your search for better outcomes. There is so much that the Google search engine can do asides from checking websites. It can be used to solve mathematics and other academic related problems, translate languages, convert several types of measurements, and get the weather forecast for your location or any other place in the world. I look forward to using fact checking sites to verify the information that I hear on the news or trending events that I am interested in. I also look forward to utilizing the “solve” tool for solving mathematics problems in school, and the “translate” tool for translating different languages when I travel overseas.</p>
