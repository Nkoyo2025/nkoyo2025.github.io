    <p>SEARCH BETTER: This video explains how to search for information on the web using the Google Search engine. I learned the basic search strategies, tips for reading webpages, getting more out of Google search, hidden features of Google search and judging online information. Judging online information deals with identifying if the information you get online is factual, accurate, reliable or sensationalized. Trustworthy websites offer objective, fact-based information, and it is essential that one verifies where the website got the information from and confirms that the website is not distorting the truth, due to bias or trying to influence one toward an assumption. I learned some ways to verify information through checking the same information across multiple sites, or utilizing fact-checking sites like, politifact.com, factcheck.org or snopes.com. These sites specialize in researching current events and claims and equally provide reliable sources for you to verify the information you need. I also learned about some hidden features of Google search that simplifies your experience while browsing the web. These hidden features highlights the benefits of using phrases like, "near me", "solve", "define", "translate" and how to narrow down a search for better outcomes. The Google search engine can do so much more than checking websites alone. It can be used to solve mathematics and other academic related problems, translate languages, convert several types of measurements, and get the weather forecast for your location or any other place in the world. I look forward to using the fact-checking sites to verify information or trending events that I am interested in. I also look forward to utilizing the “solve” tool for solving mathematics problems in school, and the “translate” tool for translating different languages when I travel overseas.</p>
  
<p>COMPARE SEARCH ENGINES: The landing pages of Google, Bing, Yahoo and Ask are different with regards to look, feel, speed and features. I searched for “web search engines” on all four search engines and the results differed from one another. On Google, the landing page was cluttered with links, videos and so much information. It had a search bar, tools to help with the search, but did not have did not have many graphics on the page. It also had an AI Overview which gave a definition and description for what I searched for, then several links and other columns were visible on the landing page. On Bing, the landing page was visually appealing, not cluttered, and had two search bars, and several tools to help with your search. It also had copilot on the page, which is AI to help with more interactive search, different links, videos, “people also checked” column, “people also asked” column, and “related search” column displayed. On Yahoo, the landing page looked dated, had a search bar and other search tool at the top, and a new AI chat feature. Several links, videos and suggestions were also visible on the page. On Ask, the landing page looked very plain, but did not show more tools to help narrow your search. It suggested several links for me to choose from, and no video was visible on his page. Google has the best user interface because it provides so much information to choose from. It was also fast too. Both Google and Bing provided the most useful results with itemized results of the search, videos, tools, suggestions and AI features. After checking “search engine market share” on Bing, it revealed that Google represented 79.1 percent of the global online search engine market on desktop devices as of March 2025, followed by Bing with 12.21 percent and Yahoo with 2.97 percent. I got to learn about the different features of all four search engines and was able to make my preferences based on the result. In my field, Google and Bing would work best for me, because of the helpful tools that they provide and the user friendly interfaces of both search engines.</p>
