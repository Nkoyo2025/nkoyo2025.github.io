     <h1>Final Project Overview</h1>

<p>The topic of my Final Project is, “HTML the Backbone of a Webpage”. The objective of this project is to highlight different aspects of HTML that are required to build a standard webpage. The scope of the project would be HTML tags, Cascading Style Sheets, and utilizing Visual Studio Code, while using the website created for this class, as my case study. A Gantt Chart has been created to help me set timelines for all the aspects of this final project. I intend to create a video for this project that would be a useful tool for beginners in this field. </p>
<p>In this lesson I got to learn about Project Management and how essential it is to the execution of any project. I was able to identify my project objectives, scope and purpose for which I chose the topic for my final project. I was also able to set timelines for each task, and list them out on the Gantt Chart template. The Gantt chart helped me itemize my ideas into attainable goals that will help me efficiently finish this project before or on the submission date. I plan to use the knowledge I gained in this lesson as I work on projects in the future, whether it relates to my field or personal pursuits.</p>
