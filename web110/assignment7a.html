     <h1>Final Project Overview</h1>

<p>The topic of my Final Project is, “HTML the Backbone of a Webpage”. The objective of this project is to highlight different aspects of HTML that are required to build a standard webpage. The scope of the project would be HTML tags, Cascading Style Sheets, and utilizing Visual Studio Code, while using the website created for this class, as my case study. A Gantt Chart has been created to help me set timelines for all the aspects of this final project. I intend to create a video for this project that would be a useful tool for beginners in this field. </p>
