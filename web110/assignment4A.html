    <p>INTERNET REFERENCE MODELS: This topic is about Internet reference models, which are standardized frameworks used to understand how data moves across networks, like the internet. They help us visualize how different technologies and protocols interact within a network. These reference models provide a way for different devices to communicate regardless of their architecture. I learned that the two reference models are Open System Interface (OSI) model and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) reference model. The OSI model is like a step-by-step guide for how computers talk to each other over a network. It has seven layers namely, Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application, with each layer doing a specific job. I also learned that the TCP/IP model is the version that the internet uses. It has four layers namely, Link, Internet, Transport and Application. The TCP/IP model is the more practical model. I envision being able to apply the concept of internet reference models when troubleshooting network issues like the internet not connecting to my devices, cables not connected properly, specific apps not working on my devices, setting up firewalls to protect my devices and so much more.</p>
 <p>INTERNET PROTOCOLS: This topic is about the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which is a connection oriented protocol that offers end-to-end packet delivery and acts as a backbone for connection. I learned that TCP is simply like the traffic controller of the internet. Before sending data, the TCP sets up a connection between the sender and receiver to make sure that data sent from one computer arrives safely and in the correct order at another computer. I also learned that web browsing, email, and file transfers all rely on TCP to work smoothly. I envision being able to apply the concept of Transmission Control Protocol, when using apps like WhatsApp, Gmail or even Dropbox when sending large files, across the internet. I also look forward to applying the knowledge of TCP into programming and web development, in the future.</p>
