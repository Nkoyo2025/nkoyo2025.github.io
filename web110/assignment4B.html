     <h1>Security</h1>
<p>INTERNERT SAFETY: Internet safety refers to the practices and precautions you take to protect yourself, your information, and your devices while using the internet. In this lesson, I learned about how to spot phishing scams, identify secure online stores, how to safely shop online while keeping my credit card and personal information secure and how to protect myself from malware. I also learned that to achieve internet safety, my computer’s operating system and internet browser are to be updated frequently, with a good malware protection software installed on my devices for extra protection. This lesson also taught me about digital tracking which is the practice of collecting data about one’s activities online. It tracks the websites I visit, apps I have and use on my devices, which advertisers can follow to learn more about my behavior, preferences, make recommendations and see my location. I envision being able to apply the concept of internet safety daily, to browse smarter, protect my identity, protect my card information, and also to protect my digital footprint.</p>

<p>INTERNET SECURITY: Internet security refers to securing communication over the internet. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. In this lesson, I learned about how threats impact the network, data security and other devices connected to the internet. I also learned about malicious links, spoofing, threats, email phishing, and how to identify them. I envision being able to apply the concept of internet security in creating unique passwords that would be difficult to hack, adding a two-factor authentication to all my accounts, frequently updating the software for all my apps and browser, try as much as I can to avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi and double checking domain names to confirm its legitimacy before browsing any sites.</p>

<p>BROWSER SAFETY: This lesson is about safely browsing the internet and keeping my online activity protected across all my devices. My favorite browser is Google Chrome. I learned how to adjust my privacy settings, verify that my browser is up to date and secure from malware, and follow the steps to manually update it when needed. I also learned how to make Chrome my default browser, since I alternate between Chrome and Bing. I envision being able to apply the knowledge gained in this lesson when browsing for work, school or leisure. </p>
