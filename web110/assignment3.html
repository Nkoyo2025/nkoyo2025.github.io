    <p>EMAIL BASICS: This topic teaches about the essential skills needed to use email effectively. Email is a service which allows us to send messages in electronic mode over the internet. It offers an efficient, inexpensive and real-time means of distributing information among people. I learned about the difference between traditional mail and electronic mail. These were subjects I knew beforehand, but this lesson gave it more clarity and itemized the similarities and differences of both. Another interesting aspect of this lesson is the etiquette and safety of email. Etiquette is the set of rules and guidelines that people use to communicate more effectively, and Safety teaches you how to protect yourself from certain risks, like malware and phishing when using your email for personal or professional use. I also learned about the different ways of writing emails for formal and informal settings, the greetings, body of the mail, attachments, using the Cc and Bcc and many other features. I plan to incorporate the etiquette and safety guidelines from this lesson into my personal and professional emails.</p>

<p>SOCIAL MEDIA: This topic teaches how to effectively use different social media platforms for personal use, professional networking, or marketing more effectively. I learned that social media can also be called social networking, which refers to grouping individuals and organizations together through some media, to share thoughts, interests, and activities. Examples of social media or social networking platforms are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ etc. All social media platforms offer different services, but they share one similarity, which is networking people from all over the world to share information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression through virtual communities. Based on the different social media networks in this lesson, the one that interests me the most is Facebook. Facebook helps me stay connected to my friends and family all over the world. I get reminders of their birthdays and celebrate with them on that day. I also get to be a part their lives through posts, like videos, pictures, writeups and any other content they share. It helps me stay connected to my roots, no matter how far away from home I am. I can also chat, call on both audio and video in real time, and join Facebook live which helps me be a part of major events in the lives of family and friends on my contact list. The Facebook user interface is  visually appealing and easy to navigate. I aim to expand my network while improving my ability to use Facebook Marketplace efficiently. </p>
