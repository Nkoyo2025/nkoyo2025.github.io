     <h1>Internet Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>EMAIL BASICS: This topic covers the key skills required for effective email communication. Email is a service that enables users to send messages electronically over the internet. It offers an efficient, inexpensive and real-time means of distributing information among people. I learned about the difference between traditional mail and electronic mail. Although I was already familiar with these subjects, this lesson provided greater clarity and clearly outlined the similarities and differences between the two types of mail. Another interesting aspect of this lesson was the etiquette and safety of email. Etiquette is the set of rules and guidelines that people use to communicate more effectively, and safety teaches you how to protect yourself from certain risks, like malware and phishing while using your email for personal or professional use. I also learned about the different ways of writing emails for formal and informal settings. I learned about the greetings, body of the mail, attachments, using the Cc and Bcc and many other features. I plan to incorporate the etiquette and safety guidelines from this lesson into my personal and professional emails.</p>

<p>SOCIAL MEDIA: This lesson focuses on the effective utilization of diverse social media platforms for personal communication, career development, and strategic marketing. I learned that social media can also be called social networking, which refers to grouping individuals and organizations together through media, to share thoughts, interests, and activities. Examples of social media platforms are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ etc. While each social media platform provides distinct services, they all share a common purpose like connecting individuals globally to exchange information, ideas, career opportunities, and personal expressions within virtual communities. Based on the different social media networks in this lesson, Facebook interests me the most. Facebook helps me stay connected with friends and family around the world. I receive birthday reminders, allowing me to celebrate their special moments, and I enjoy sharing in their lives through posts like videos, photos, stories, or other content. Even when Iâ€™m far from home, it helps me feel rooted and close to my loved ones. I can chat, make real time audio and video calls, and join Facebook Live events, which lets me take part in significant milestones and celebrations from wherever I am. I intend to use Facebook more and learn about its new features that come up in the future. The Facebook user interface is also  visually appealing and easy to navigate.  </p> 

 <p>COMMUNICATIONS: Internet services provides access to the internet and various online services such as text, graphics, sound, streaming, online gaming, cloud computing, email and software over the internet. Communications is  an aspect of Internet services. Some examples of Communications are email, Telnet, Mailing List, Internet Telephony (VoIP), and Instant Messaging. VoIP is known as Voice Over Internet Protocol, which simply means a technology that lets you make voice calls using an internet connection instead of a traditional phone line. Common examples of VoIP are WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Skype, Zoom, Google voice and so much more. I learned about the advantages of using VoIP for communication. Some of the advantages are flexibility to make both local and international calls. VoIP is cost effective, as most of the calls are free, and it can be linked with other software systems like email, CRM platforms, or productivity suites. I have installed WhatsApp on my phone and look forward to utilizing it for both local and international communication and various other purposes like sharing of images, videos, documents, voice notes, and even live locations.</p>
