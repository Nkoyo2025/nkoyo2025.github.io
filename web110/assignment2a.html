     <h1>Web Browsers</h1>
    <p>WEB BROWSER:The lesson on Web Browser has enlightened me of the distinction between Browsers and Vendors. A web browser simply called browser, is a software application that allows users to access and interact with the World Wide Web, while the vendor is a company or organization responsible for developing, maintaining, and distributing web browsers. The three major components of all web browsers are: Controller/Dispatcher, Interpreter, and Client Programs. Internet explorer is the default browser that is installed on all windows computers. To utilize the browser, you are to type the URL into the address bar and click on search. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. I also learned that web pages and web elements like pictures and links can be saved. I was only familiar with bookmarking a webpage as a favorite, so you can return to it when needed. I also learned that the list of all favorites can be organized by categorizing web pages, creating folders for them and then storing web pages into these folders. Different browsers offer several benefits to its users. Some of such benefits are speed and performance, security features, user friendly interface, synchronization across devices and so much more. I plan to learn more about hyperlinks and how they can be utilized in my daily life as I browse web pages.</p>
<p>INTERNET TIPS:Internet tips gives you insight to using the internet more productively. I learned more about Understanding App permissions and Understanding URLs. To understand app permissions, you have to read through the permissions after installing the apps to your device, before granting any permissions or using the app. If you are unsure of what the app is requesting, do not permit, so you do not grant the app access to your sensitive information, and you can't control how the information would be used. Also I learned that when looking for apps to download to your device, you are to look for the apps with the category, "Editor's choice". This category highlights the most trustworthy apps in the playstore or appstore. From the video about Understanding URLs, I got to know the Scheme of a URL. The scheme tells the browser what kind of address it is, whether it is a http, or https. I also learned that https is used when extra security is needed. I got to understand that a URL is divided into parts like the domain name, which begins with a sub domain which tells you the company that runs the site, and the rightmost part of the domain name which is the top level domain, like .com, .edu, .org. I intend to consciously download apps that are Editor's choice, to ensure that I have a level of safety on all apps on my devices, and also ensure that I trust the sites that I visit, as I browse the internet. </p>
