    <p>The lesson on Web Browser has enlightened me of the distinction between Browsers and Vendors. A web browser simply called browser, is a software application that allows users to access and interact with the World Wide Web, while the vendor is a company or organization responsible for developing, maintaining, and distributing web browsers. The three major components of all web browsers are: Controller/Dispatcher, Interpreter, and Client Programs. Internet explorer is the default browser that is installed on all windows computers. To utilize the browser, you are to type the URL into the address bar and click on search. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. I also learned that web pages and web elements like pictures and links can be saved. I was only familiar with bookmarking a webpage as a favorite, so you can return to it when needed. The list of all favorites can be organized by categorizing web pages, creating folders for them and then storing web pages into these folders. Different browsers offer several benefits to its users. Some of such benefits are speed and performance, security features, user friendly interface, synchronization across devices and so much more. I plan to learn more about hyperlinks and how they can be utilized in my daily life as I browse web pages.</p>
