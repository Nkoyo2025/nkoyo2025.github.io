    <h1>HTML the Backbone of a Webpage.</h1>
    <p>This course taught me so much more than using the internet for browsing alone. I got to utilize the basic HTML template to create my website with different web pages and formatted the tags and links to meet the weekly assigned tasks. I got to work with CSS to format the content on each page, like the background color, font size, font family, and font color. I also got to work with HTML tags like the head tag, body tag, paragraphs tags, headings tag, ordered list, and unordered list and so much more. I was also able to add images, link videos, audios and YouTube pages on different web pages. I learned the basics of Project Management and Database Management too. I intend to keep learning and practicing, so I build more functional websites that can be utilized by everyone regardless of their abilities</p>
