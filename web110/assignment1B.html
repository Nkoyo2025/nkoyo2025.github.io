    <p>Internet Basics: I learned from the Internet Basics tutorial that more can be done on the internet than just surfing the internet and browsing different websites to view products and services. I learned about what the internet is, how to safely navigate the web, how to recover lost passwords, how to understand app permissions, basic search strategies using specific keywords that would help one narrow down any search to yield better results, internet safety and so much more. The world is fast becoming more dependent on the internet, so I envision this tutorial would introduce internet users to concepts, tools, and best practices for navigating the internet efficiently and safely to prevent spam and phishing or losing personal information or accounts to hackers. This tutorial is beneficial to everyone and not just people starting a tech career.</p>

<p>Git Tutorial: I learned from the Git Tutorial that Git is widely used in the tech industry, as an open-source distributed version control system, that is used to track changes in computer files, allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without overwriting the other, while it coordinates changes and maintains a history of modifications. I envision myself  understanding Git better, and making use of it in my career in Computer Information Systems, to work on my own projects, collaborate with others on projects, then hosting and showcasing my projects on Git based platforms, as I build my portfolio.</p>

<p>Understanding Apps: I learned about what an app is, the specific tasks that they perform and how an app is called desktop application on a laptop or desktop computer, and mobile apps on mobile devices. I also learned how to install apps on any computer or mobile device. The knowledge gained from this tutorial is beneficial to me, because I can confidently download any app on my computer by myself and install it for use.</p>
