    <p>CSS: In this lesson, I learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is the design layer of the web page. CSS can be inserted into HTML pages through the External style sheet, Internal Style sheet and Inline style. These style sheets are used to control the layout of multiple web pages. I also learned that CSS handles the text colors, background colors, font family, font size, borders, margins and padding. I learned when to apply <link> and <style> respectively. I hope to be able to implement the knowledge of CSS when designing websites, I create for both professional and personal use.
