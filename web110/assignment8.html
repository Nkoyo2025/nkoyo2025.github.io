<p>DATABASES: In this lesson, I learned that a database is a highly organized collection of data that stores, manages, and retrieves data so that information can be accessed, updated, and organized efficiently. It is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). Data is often organized into tables, like spreadsheets, where each row is a record and each column is a field. I also learned that SQL (Structured Query Language) is the programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). I anticipate using databases in web development, tracking inventory, analyzing large data sets to find patterns like the Northwind database assigned to us in this course, and also for general storage of data for both personal and professional purposes.  </p>
