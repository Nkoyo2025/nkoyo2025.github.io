    <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
    <p>In this lesson I learned that Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG are built around four core principles, which are PERCEIVABLE, so that people can see the content and hear it, OPERABLE, so that people can use the computer by typing or by voice, UNDERSTANDABLE, so people get clear and simple language, and ROBUST, so people can use different assistive technologies. I also learned how to validate if the website created can be accessible to people with disabilities. This required that I change some font styles and change the background color of one of my pages to match the other pages of my website. I anticipate using the knowledge gained in this lesson to build standard websites that would not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also accessible to all.</p>
