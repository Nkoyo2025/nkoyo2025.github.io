    <p>In this lesson, I learned how to use Bing Image Creator to create an AI generated image. In the prompt box I typed the description of the image I wanted to create, then uploaded the result in a folder on my laptop and in Visual Studio Code. I also learned how to create an HTML image link, which I added to my webpage. I tried using PicFinder and Adobe Firefly, but both tools did not display where the images could be edited or downloaded. The three AI image creation tools were similar, but Bing Image Creator was user friendly for a beginner.</p>
