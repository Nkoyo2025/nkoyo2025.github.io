        <p>This weekâ€™s HTML lesson was very insightful but very challenging. I learned about the different HTML tags, and how they can be used in creating a website. I learned about the three layers that make up a webpage. The first layer is the HTML which provides the Content layer, then the CSS, which provides the Presentation layer and JavaScript, which represents the Behavior layer that is responsible for how users interact with the page elements. With more practice, I hope to utilize the knowledge gained in this lesson to create websites that would be functional and beneficial to the users. </p>
